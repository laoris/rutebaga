Things we're going to implement when we're done.

* A ranged damage effect has mass and imparts momentum when it strikes its target.
* Show enemies' hitpoints beneath/next to their appearance on the map view, separate from the 'observation' view (but it might use the observation skill).
* A damage effect that continues going even after it's hit its target, possibly hitting other targets in its path.
