To add a page, use the box in the nav menu.

To add tags to a page, use the "tags" at the bottom when you are **viewing** a page.

To set the parent of a page (you'll need to do this for your class overviews), use "options" > "parent".

There is a good overview of the syntax [http://www.wikidot.com/doc:wiki-syntax here].

You can upload images and associate them with a page-- use the "files" link at the bottom of the page.
