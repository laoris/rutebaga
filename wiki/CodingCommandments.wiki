#summary Commandments that we Shall Not break in our designs and implementations.

# You shall not use static references in your code;
# You shall not make designs that require static references, as Dave eats them for breakfast;
# You shall not use enumerations unless expressedly required, as they violate OCP;
# You shall not use literal tokens, as they are worse than enumerations;
# You shall not declare any field with an access modifier other than "private";
# You shall not break the Law of Demeter unless expressedly required, as this is structurally binding;
# You shall not use double dispatch judiciously, as visitor interfaces violate OCP; and,
# You shall not use typecasts unless the JVM requires it, as typecasts rely on hidden details of operations that are not documented.
