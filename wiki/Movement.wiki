=Velocity-Based Model=

Each instance that has location contains a vector representing its velocity.  This vector is managed solely by the environment; that is, the instance cannot directly alter it.

Affecting this vector is done through a public operation that applies a force to the instance.

Before forwarding ticks, the environment iterates through its instances.  Based on each instance's velocity, it determines:

  * if the instance is about to cross a tile boundary
  * if so, whether or not it is able to enter that tile

And accordingly,

  * moves the instance, or
  * does not move the instance

Regardless, the velocity vector is reset after this has completed.

=Momentum-Based Model=

Take a lot of acid, and then write some code.  See what happens.  Cool colors.
