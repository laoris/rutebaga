 * Given a set of Instances, ActionDeterminer produces a list of named Commands
 * in the form of an ElementalList. ActionDeterminer exposes a single operation,
 * determineActions, which uses a Filter todetermine which Instance in a set of
 * Instances should be targeted. Once it determines the target, it determines
 * which actions are appropriate for the targeted Instance.
 * 
 * For instance, if an Entity is present at a Location, it will be targeted and
 * Commands encapsulating actions appropriate for an Entity, such as attacking
 * or talking, will be generated.
